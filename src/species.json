It is closely associated with, and largely confined to, cool dry ponderosa pine forests. It is named in honor of the American naturalist John James Abert; nine subspecies are recognised. It is recognizable by its tufted ears, gray color, pale underparts and rufous patch on the lower back. The squirrel feeds on the seeds and cones of the Mexican pinyon and the ponderosa pine when they are available, but will also take fungi, buds, bark, and carrion. Breeding normally occurs in summer, with a spherical nest being built high in the canopy.","conservation_status":"LC"},{"title":"Agile kangaroo rat","description":"species of mammal","desktop_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_kangaroo_rat","mobile_url":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_kangaroo_rat","extract":"The agile kangaroo rat is a species of rodent in the family Heteromyidae.

They are emaciated when emerging in the spring. These long periods of torpor earned the squirrels the moniker \"Seven Sleepers\", since the rests last around seven months.

The Eastern small footed bat is rare throughout its range, although the species may be locally abundant where suitable habitat exists. Studies suggest white-nose syndrome has caused declines in their populations. However, most occurrences of this species have only been counted within the past decade or two and are not revisited regularly, making their population status difficult to assess. Additionally, bat populations in the Eastern U.S. have typically been monitored using surveys conducted in caves and mines in the winter, but small-footed bats hibernate in places that make them unlikely to be encountered during these surveys. As a result, numbers of small-footed bats counted in winter tend to be low and relatively variable compared to other species of bats.

Moose typically inhabit boreal forests and temperate broadleaf and mixed forests of the Northern Hemisphere in temperate to subarctic climates. Hunting and other human activities have caused a reduction in the size of the moose's range over time. Moose have been reintroduced to some of their former habitats. Currently, most moose are found in Canada, Alaska, New England, Fennoscandia, Baltic states, and Russia. Their diet consists of both terrestrial and aquatic vegetation. The most common moose predators are the gray wolf along with bears and humans. Unlike most other deer species, moose do not form herds and are solitary animals, aside from calves who remain with their mother until the cow begins estrus, at which point the cow chases away young bulls. Although generally slow-moving and sedentary, moose can become aggressive and move quickly if angered or startled. Their mating season in the autumn features energetic fights between males competing for a female.","conservation_status":"LC"},{"title":"Mouflon","thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Mouflon_in_zoo.jpg/320px-Mouflon_in_zoo.jpg","width":320,"height":213},"image":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Mouflon_in_zoo.jpg","width":3456,"height":2304},"description":"common name","desktop_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouflon","mobile_url":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouflon","extract":"The mouflon is a subspecies group of the wild sheep.

Human intervention has spread its distribution further, making the species one of the widest-ranging mammals in the world, as well as the most widely spread suiform. Its wide range, high numbers, and adaptability mean that it is classed as least concern by the IUCN and it has become an invasive species in part of its introduced range. The animal probably originated in Southeast Asia during the Early Pleistocene, and outcompeted other suid species as it spread throughout the Old World.","conservation_status":"LC"},{"title":"Wolf","thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/European_grey_wolf_in_Prague_zoo.jpg/291px-European_grey_wolf_in_Prague_zoo.jpg","width":291,"height":320},"image":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/European_grey_wolf_in_Prague_zoo.jpg","width":1412,"height":1552},"description":"species of mammal","desktop_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf","mobile_url":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf","extract":"The wolf, also known as the grey/gray wolf or timber wolf, is a canine native to the wilderness and remote areas of Eurasia and North America.
